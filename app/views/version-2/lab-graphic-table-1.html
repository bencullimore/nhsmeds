<p>Paracetamol is a common painkiller for children. It's often used to treat <a href="/conditions/headache">headaches</a>, <a href="/conditions/stomach-ache-abdominal-pain/">stomach ache</a>, <a href="/conditions/earache/">earache</a>, and <a href="/conditions/Cold-common/">cold symptoms</a>. It can also be used to bring down a high temperature (<a href="/conditions/fever-in-children/">fever</a>).</p>

<p>For children aged 2 months to 12 years, paracetamol comes as a syrup.</p>

<p>For children aged 6 years or older, paracetamol is available as tablets. </p>

<p>Paracetamol is also available as suppositories (medicine that's pushed gently into a child's bottom). Suppositories are useful to relieve pain and fever in children who find it difficult to swallow tablets or syrup, or who are being sick a lot.</p>

<p>For teenagers aged 16 and over, read our information on <a href="/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/">paracetamol for adults</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are different types of paracetamol for children, including 2 strengths of syrup. The strength and <a href="/medicines/paracetamol-for-children/#dosage">dosage</a> depends on your child's age (and sometimes weight), so always read the instructions carefully.</li>
<li>Your child should start to feel better about 30 minutes after taking tablets or syrup. Suppositories can take up to 60 minutes to work properly.</li>
<li>Do not give your child paracetamol at the same time as other medicines containing paracetamol, such as Lemsip.</li>
<li>Paracetamol is an everyday medicine, but it can be dangerous if your child takes too much. Be careful to keep it out of the reach of children.</li>
<li>Paracetamol is known by many different brand names, including Disprol, Hedex, Medinol and Panadol. Paracetamol syrup is also known by the brand name Calpol.</li>

<h3>How often to give paracetamol</h3>

<p>If your child needs help with pain day and night for several days (usually up to 3 days), give a dose of paracetamol every 6 hours. This will help to relieve the pain safely without the risk of giving too much paracetamol.</p>

<p>If your child has pain that comes and goes, give a dose of paracetamol when they first complain of pain. Wait at least 4 hours before giving another dose. </p>

<p>Paracetamol can be taken with or without food.</p>

<h4>Syrup</h4>

<p>Shake the bottle well for at least 10 seconds and measure out the right amount using the plastic syringe or spoon that comes with the medicine. If you don't have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount.</p>

<p>If your child doesn't like the taste, you can give them a drink of milk or fruit juice straight after giving them the syrup.</p>

<h4>Tablets</h4>

<p>Tablets should be swallowed with a glass of water, milk, or juice. Tell your child not to chew the tablet.</p>

<p>Soluble tablets should be dissolved in at least half a glass of water. Stir to make sure the tablet has dissolved completely and then give it to your child to drink.</p>

<p>Calpol Fast Melts shouldn't be swallowed - ask your child to let the tablet dissolve on their tongue.</p>

<h4>Suppositories</h4>

<p>Paracetamol suppositories are medicine that you push gently into your child's bottom.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions on the leaflet that comes with the medicine.</p>

<p>If your baby is in pain or has a high temperature (including fever after having <a href="/conditions/vaccinations/">vaccinations</a>, you can give them 1 dose of paracetamol syrup  (or 1 suppository). </p>

<p>The usual dose is 2.5ml of infant syrup (or a 60mg suppository). If your baby was premature, or they're small for their age, check with your doctor or health visitor. They may recommend a lower dose.</p>

<p>You can give your baby 1 more dose of syrup 4 hours later, if they need it. If they still have a high temperature after this, contact your doctor or a pharmacist.</p>

<p><strong>MenB vaccinations</strong></p>

<p>When your baby has their <a href="/conditions/vaccinations/meningitis-b-vaccine/">meningitis B vaccinations</a> at 8 weeks and 16 weeks, your health visitor will tell you to bring infant syrup to the appointment. </p>

<p>You're recommended to give them paracetamol 3 times to prevent a high temperature. The usual dose is::</p>

<ul>
<li>2.5ml as soon as possible after the vaccination</li>
<li>2.5ml 4 to 6 hours after the first dose</li>
<li>2.5ml 4 to 6 hours after the second dose</li>

<p><a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/ibuprofen-for-children/">Ibuprofen</a> is the only safe painkiller to give children alongside paracetamol. However do not give paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time. </p>

<p>You need to give these medicines one at a time (unless your child’s doctor or nurse gives you different instructions).</p>

<h3>For high temperature</h3>

<p>If you've given your child paracetamol and they're still feverish after 1 or 2 hours, you could try giving them ibuprofen.</p>

<p>If this helps bring down their temperature, carry on giving them ibuprofen instead of paracetamol. Follow the instructions that come with the medicine.</p>

<p>Do not give more than the maximum daily dose of either medicine.</p>

<p>See your doctor if you've tried both paracetamol and ibuprofen and they haven't helped.</p>

<h3>For pain (including teething)</h3>

<p>If you've given your child paracetamol and they're still in pain 2 hours later, you could try giving ibuprofen.</p>

<p>If this combination works, continue to alternate between paracetamol and ibuprofen. Give 1 medicine every 2 to 3 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Do not give more than the maximum daily dose of either medicine.</strong></p>

<p>See your doctor if you've tried alternating paracetamol and ibuprofen and they haven't helped. Also see your doctor if you don’t know what is causing your child’s pain.</p>

<h3>Other medicines containing paracetamol</h3>

<p>Do not give your child another medicine with paracetamol in it. If they take 2 different medicines that contain paracetamol, there's a risk of overdose.</p>

<p>Paracetamol is an ingredient in lots of medicines that you can buy from the pharmacy or supermarket. These include Lemsip, and Day and Night Nurse capsules or liquid (only suitable for children over 12 years).</p>
