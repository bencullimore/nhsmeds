        <p>Sore throats are very common and usually nothing to worry about. They normally get better by themselves within a week.</p>
    <h2>How to treat a sore throat yourself</h2>
      <p>To help soothe a sore throat and shorten how long it lasts you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>gargle with warm salty water (children shouldn't try this)</li>
          <li>drink plenty of water – but avoid hot drinks</li>
          <li>eat cool or soft foods</li>
          <li>avoid smoking or smoky places</li>
          <li>suck ice cubes, ice lollies or hard sweets – but don't give young children anything small and hard to suck because of the risk of choking</li>
          <li>rest</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>A pharmacist can help with sore throats</h2>
        <p>To help relieve the pain and discomfort of a sore throat you can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>use <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults">paracetamol</a> or <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults">ibuprofen</a></li>
            <li>use medicated lozenges or anaesthetic sprays (although there's little proof they help)</li>
          </ul>
        <p>You can buy them from a supermarket or from a pharmacist without a prescription.</p>

      <h3>Antibiotics</h3>
        <p>GPs don't normally prescribe antibiotics for sore throats because they won't usually relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.</p>

         <h2>Causes and symptoms of sore throats</h2>   
          <p>Sore throats are usually caused by viruses (like cold or flu) or from smoking. Very occasionally they can be caused by bacteria.</p>
          <p>Symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>painful throat, especially when swallowing</li>
              <li>dry scratchy throat</li>
              <li>redness in the back of the mouth</li>
              <li>bad breath</li>
              <li>mild cough</li>
              <li>swollen neck glands</li>
            </ul>


          <p>The symptoms are similar for children, but children can also get a temperature and appear less active.</p>
